# Unreal Engine 5 Game Projects

Welcome to my collection of Unreal Engine 5 game projects. This repository contains three exciting projects where I've experimented with various game mechanics, animations, and sound effects to create immersive gaming experiences. Here's what each project encompasses:

## Project 1

This project offers a dynamic gaming environment featuring:

- **Character Movement and Sound Effects**
  - Realistic footstep sounds synchronized with the running animation.
  - Running dust effects generated at the character's feet.

- **Environmental Interactions**
  - Randomly generated falling leaves with accompanying rustling sounds upon touching the ground.

- **Combat Mechanics**
  - A cannon model that the character can fire forward upon left-click, coupled with corresponding firing animations and sound effects.

## Project 2

Taking inspiration from popular assassin games, this project introduces the following features:

- **Stealthy Movement**
  - A new skeletal animation for the character, allowing for a forward-leaning posture during a sprint, mimicking the swift and stealthy run of an assassin.
  - Altered footstep sounds to match the new running animation.

- **Dynamic Camera Angles**
  - Upon entering a specific area, the camera automatically transitions to a preset angle, followed by a gradual elevation and rotation, offering a wide-angle aerial view of both the character and the surroundings.

## Project 3

This project explores advanced AI and obstacle navigation mechanics with features such as:

- **Enemy AI**
  - A hostile AI entity that actively seeks out the player within a 180-degree field of view and maintains pursuit as long as the player remains in sight, retreating only when the player exits its patrol radius.

- **Obstacle Navigation**
  - Integration of obstacles throughout the map with restricted access, enforced through infinitely high pathfinding costs, effectively prohibiting entry.
  - Special points on the surface of obstacles, which permit the character to jump over them, offering a strategic depth to navigation.
  - Both player and enemy AI can opt to leap down from heights instead of taking a more cost-effective path down a slope, enhancing realism and unpredictability in navigation.
